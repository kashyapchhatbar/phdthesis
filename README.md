## Source Code for Bioinformatics Workflows and Models

This repository contains bioinformatics workflows and machine learning models used in my research. It ensures reproducibility and transparency by providing pipelines for data processing, predictive modeling, and explainability analysis.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

#### MeCP2_2022_manuscript

This folder contains the analysis pipeline and scripts related to the study on whether MeCP2 binds to CA repeats [![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Manuscript-10.26508%2Flsa.202201522-%232B519E)](https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.202201522). 

#### SHAP-analysis

This folder includes the machine learning models and explainable AI (XAI) approaches used to infer regulatory interactions in transcriptional regulation [![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/bioR%CF%87iv%20DOI-10.1101%2F2025.01.30.635704%20-BC2635)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.30.635704)

#### Bioinformatics Workflows

This folder contains Snakemake workflows for processing high-throughput sequencing data, specifically TT-seq, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq.
